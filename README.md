- 📜 Revision History:
Track every change made to your documents with our comprehensive modification history. Gain insight into every edit and maintain full control over your content.

## 💡Inspiration:

- College Hostels are one of those authorities that still adhere to the old-fashioned Pass Book system,
  requiring students to maintain track of the type of Leaves and Applications they are requesting in
  their respective Passbooks. The students are also required to draft the application and get those
  signed manually in the Passbooks by the respective authority member in order to get approval.
- This traditional process of getting the Leaves/ Applications signed manually has a lot of drawbacks,
  which includes:
  1. Hassle for the student to Write and Get the Applications signed manually.
  2. In the case of Application For Night Pass, the student has to get the application approved both by the 
     Hostel's Warden and Parent/ Guardian, which increases the time for getting the approval.
  3. If a large number of Applications are received by the Hostel's Warden, it becomes difficult for
     them to Manage, Review and Sign the Applications.
- Keeping all these issues in mind, we came up with the concept to Digitalize this approach by building
  Sign Ease, an Android application that has integrated APIs by **Hello Sign** and assists the students 
  in getting their Leaves and Applications signed Digitally by the respective Authority Member. Also, it 
  helps the Wardens/ Authority Members to keep track of all the applications that they've signed.


## 💬 What it does:

- 📊 Streamlined Document Generation: Upon launching the app, users harness the power of AI to effortlessly craft legally sound documents. Define your prompt in concise phrases, and watch as the application generates intricate legal documents with unparalleled precision.

- 🖋️ Document Review and Modification: Dive into the generated document, meticulously reviewing and refining it to align with your specific needs. Customize the content, seamlessly integrate signer details, and prepare the document for the next stage: authentication.

- 📑 Centralized Document Management: Keep your finger on the pulse of your documents with the 'My Docs' screen, which provides an overview of all documents queued for signatures, ensuring a bird's-eye view of your workflow.

- 🔏 Biometric Document Signatures: With a simple click, enter the realm of document authentication. Utilize biometric authentication powered by Dropbox Sign to endorse documents securely. Your signature, unique and irreplaceable, solidifies the document's authenticity.

- 🌐 Secure Decentralized Storage: Upon receiving endorsements from all signatories, the document takes its permanent place in a highly secure decentralized storage. Wrapped in an impenetrable tamper seal, the document's integrity remains unscathed.

- 🔀 Modification with Signer Agreement: Navigate the delicate terrain of document modification with the unanimous consent of all signatories. However, bear in mind that any alterations trigger the voiding of the tamper seal, obfuscating the hash/path of the decentralized storage. The document generation process must then commence anew.

- 📅 Comprehensive Modification History: Gain unparalleled insights into document evolution. Explore the detailed history of modifications, complete with timestamps and user attributions, enabling you to track every transformation.

- 👁️ Preview with Biometric Authentication: Unlock the ability to preview signed documents securely. Biometric authentication grants exclusive access to review the document's contents, ensuring sensitive information remains confidential.

- 📃 Document Summarization: Condense the essence of your document with ease. On biometric authentication, access the summarization feature to distill complex legal documents into concise, digestible insights.

## 🛠 How we built it

- Hello Sign, Kotlin (MVVM, NavGraphs, Coroutines, Retrofit, Koin, Clean Architecture), XML, Postman, Firebase (Authentication, Firestore, Storage, Crashlytics, Analytics), APIs, Figma.

## ❗Challenges we ran into:

- As our placement season is going on, managing exams + interviews along with the project.
- Integration of blockchain and IPFS for storing and managing tamper-sealed files.
- Enabling IFrame for embedded signing led to use GitHub pages.

## 🏆 Accomplishments that we're proud of:
- Eliminating the Manual Job for both Students and Authorities to get their Docs signed.
- Implemented Bottom Sheets and WebView successfully.
- Segregated different blocks of code and efficiently handled its operation, thus following a clean code architecture (MVVM).

## 📙 What we learned:
- Usage and working of Hello-Sign APIs and how they benefit society.
- Learned using NavGraphs and Logging Interceptor for Networking Calls.
- Improved our Application Architecture by writing more Efficient Code.

## ❓ What's next for Sign Ease

1. Able to embed logs of Leaves and the Applications on the identity cards of students.
2. Adding more Templates and Signers across the spectrum of a College.
3. Build a cross-platform service that can work on multiple Operating Systems.
4. Build another Portal for the Authorities to sign the documents then and there instead of
   opening the e-mails again and again. All by keeping **Hello Sign** as the backbone.
