## 💬 What it does:

- 📊 Streamlined Document Generation: Upon launching the app, users harness the power of AI to effortlessly craft legally sound documents. Define your prompt in concise phrases, and watch as the application generates intricate legal documents with unparalleled precision.

- 🖋️ Document Review and Modification: Dive into the generated document, meticulously reviewing and refining it to align with your specific needs. Customize the content, seamlessly integrate signer details, and prepare the document for the next stage: authentication.

- 📑 Centralized Document Management: Keep your finger on the pulse of your documents with the 'My Docs' screen, which provides an overview of all documents queued for signatures, ensuring a bird's-eye view of your workflow.

- 🔏 Biometric Document Signatures: With a simple click, enter the realm of document authentication. Utilize biometric authentication combined with Dropbox Sign to endorse documents securely. Your signature, unique and irreplaceable, solidifies the document's authenticity.

- 🌐 Secure Decentralized Storage: Upon receiving endorsements from all signatories, the document takes its permanent place in a highly secure decentralized storage. Wrapped in an impenetrable tamper seal, the document's integrity remains unscathed.

- 🔀 Modification with Signer Agreement: Navigate the delicate terrain of document modification with the unanimous consent of all signatories. However, bear in mind that any alterations trigger the voiding of the tamper seal, obfuscating the hash/path of the agreement in its decentralized storage. The document generation process must then commence anew.

## 🛠 How we built it

- Dropbox Sign, Kotlin (MVVM, NavGraphs, Coroutines, Retrofit, Koin, Clean Architecture), XML, Postman, Firebase (Authentication, Firestore, Storage, Crashlytics, Analytics), APIs, Figma, IPFS, Infura, Blockchain, Biometrics.

## ❗Challenges we ran into:

- As our college placement season is going on, managing exams + interviews along with the project was a tedious task.
- Integration of blockchain and IPFS for storing and managing tamper-sealed files led us to invest 3-4 days in exploring blockchain.
- Enabling IFrame for embedded signing caused a crash on Android Webview, so integrated GitHub pages for deploying the JS with HTML, then generating a link for signing docs.

## 🏆 Accomplishments that we're proud of:
- Incorporated Smart Contracts, Blockchain, Biometric Signatures and Authentications.
- Segregated different blocks of code and efficiently handled its operation, thus following a clean code architecture (MVVM).

## 📙 What we learned:
- How to manage time, be efficient, and handle multiple tasks at multiple times.
- Usage and working of Dropbox-Sign APIs and how they benefit society.
- Incorporation of Blockchain, Tamper Seals, and GitHub Actions Pipelines for respective tasks in app.

## ❓ What's next for Sign Ease
- Able to add propts using Audio.
- Getting notifications if the documents are not signed yet.
- Usage of NFC for signing contracts.
