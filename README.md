## 🥁Introduction:

Welcome to Legal Vault: Your Gateway to Secure, Decentralized Document Management

Are you ready to revolutionize the way you handle legal documents? Introducing Dropbox Sign, a groundbreaking application powered by cutting-edge AI technology and blockchain integration. With Legal Vault, we bring you a seamless and highly secure document generation, signing, storage, and management solution that redefines the standards of trust and authenticity.

- 🤖 AI-Powered Document Generation:
Experience the future of document creation with our AI-driven platform. Create legally sound documents effortlessly, saving you time and ensuring accuracy.

- 🖋️ Biometric Signatures:
Your signatures, your way. Incorporate biometric authentication to ensure that signatures are as unique as you are, making document signing more secure than ever before.

- 🔏 Tamper-Resistant Documents:
Rest easy knowing your signed documents are protected by an unbreakable tamper seal. Any unauthorized modifications will render the document void, providing unparalleled data integrity.

- 🌐 Decentralized Storage:
Say goodbye to centralized servers and hello to blockchain-powered decentralization. Your documents are stored securely on a distributed network, immune to data breaches and unauthorized access.

- 🔒 Biometric Authentication:
Access your signed documents with ease, all while maintaining the highest level of security. Biometric authentication ensures that only authorized individuals can view and modify documents.

- 📜 Revision History:
Track every change made to your documents with our comprehensive modification history. Gain insight into every edit and maintain full control over your content.

## 💬 What it does:

- 📊 Streamlined Document Generation: Upon launching the app, users harness the power of AI to effortlessly craft legally sound documents. Define your prompt in concise phrases, and watch as the application generates intricate legal documents with unparalleled precision.

- 🖋️ Document Review and Modification: Dive into the generated document, meticulously reviewing and refining it to align with your specific needs. Customize the content, seamlessly integrate signer details, and prepare the document for the next stage: authentication.

- 📑 Centralized Document Management: Keep your finger on the pulse of your documents with the 'My Docs' screen, which provides an overview of all documents queued for signatures, ensuring a bird's-eye view of your workflow.

- 🔏 Biometric Document Signatures: With a simple click, enter the realm of document authentication. Utilize biometric authentication powered by Dropbox Sign to endorse documents securely. Your signature, unique and irreplaceable, solidifies the document's authenticity.

- 🌐 Secure Decentralized Storage: Upon receiving endorsements from all signatories, the document takes its permanent place in a highly secure decentralized storage. Wrapped in an impenetrable tamper seal, the document's integrity remains unscathed.

- 🔀 Modification with Signer Agreement: Navigate the delicate terrain of document modification with the unanimous consent of all signatories. However, bear in mind that any alterations trigger the voiding of the tamper seal, obfuscating the hash/path of the decentralized storage. The document generation process must then commence anew.

- 📅 Comprehensive Modification History: Gain unparalleled insights into document evolution. Explore the detailed history of modifications, complete with timestamps and user attributions, enabling you to track every transformation.

- 👁️ Preview with Biometric Authentication: Unlock the ability to preview signed documents securely. Biometric authentication grants exclusive access to review the document's contents, ensuring sensitive information remains confidential.

## 🛠 How we built it

- Hello Sign, Kotlin (MVVM, NavGraphs, Coroutines, Retrofit, Koin, Clean Architecture), XML, Postman, Firebase (Authentication, Firestore, Storage, Crashlytics, Analytics), APIs, Figma.

## ❗Challenges we ran into:

- As our college placement season is going on, managing exams + interviews along with the project was a tedious task.
- Integration of blockchain and IPFS for storing and managing tamper-sealed files led us to invest 3-4 days in exploring blockchain.
- Enabling IFrame for embedded signing caused a crash on Android Webview, so integrated GitHub pages for deploying the JS with HTML, then generating a link for signing docs.

## 🏆 Accomplishments that we're proud of:
- Incorporated Smart Contracts, Blockchain, Biometric Signatures and Authentications.
- Segregated different blocks of code and efficiently handled its operation, thus following a clean code architecture (MVVM).

## 📙 What we learned:
- How to manage time, be efficient, and handle multiple tasks at multiple times.
- Usage and working of Dropbox-Sign APIs and how they benefit society.
- Incorporation of Blockchain, Tamper Seals, and GitHub Actions Pipelines for respective tasks in app.

## ❓ What's next for Sign Ease
- Able to add propts using Audio.
- Getting notifications if the documents are not signed yet.
- Usage of NFC for signing contracts.
